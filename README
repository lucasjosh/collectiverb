I'm making my way thru the Programming Collective Intelligence book but all of the code is Python.  I'm reworking what I can into Ruby.  I know there are others that have done the same but I wanted to start from a clean slate.

Chapter 3 requirements:
simple-rss gem
RMagick

	or

There is currently an error being generated when trying to create the 2d image.  I'll be looking into that as time goes in.
